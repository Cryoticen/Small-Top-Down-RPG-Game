# Mini:Top-Down-RPG-Game
This is a small RPG game that i made as a part of a project on the C++ course at my university.
The graphics were made only using the Simple Game Graphics Library https://github.com/cgaueb/sgg .
I made the entire logic from zero and even though it may be simplistic it might be worth taking a look at. 
Also all the assets-sprites are either royalty free(reference in credits) or made by me.
